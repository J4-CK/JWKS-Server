# JWKS-Server README
Introduction
This project aims to implement a JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) server using Flask in Python. The JWKS server is responsible for providing a set of public keys used for JWT (JSON Web Token) verification.

Struggles and Challenges
Throughout the development of this project, I encountered several struggles and challenges, particularly in implementing the JWKS endpoint and ensuring proper cooperation with the authentication endpoint.

One of the main struggles I faced was understanding the intricacies of JWKS and how to properly implement it in my application. Initially, I underestimated the complexity of the task, which led to frustration and confusion.

I also struggled with ensuring proper communication between the JWKS endpoint and the authentication endpoint. It was challenging to design the architecture in a way that allowed for seamless integration and efficient retrieval of public keys.

Reflection and Lessons Learned
Reflecting on this project, I realize that I underestimated the difficulty level of implementing a JWKS server given my current programming abilities. It became apparent that I needed to reach out to peers and other resources for guidance and support.

I deeply regret any shortcomings or subpar aspects of this project. As someone who strives for excellence, I am disappointed in the quality of work produced. I understand the importance of delivering high-quality solutions and will work diligently to ensure that the next version of this project meets acceptable standards.

Moving forward, I am committed to learning from this experience and improving my skills in both programming and project management. I will seek guidance from mentors, engage in further research, and dedicate additional time to practice and experimentation.

Conclusion
In conclusion, I apologize for any shortcomings in this project and acknowledge the importance of delivering high-quality work. Despite the challenges faced, I am determined to learn from this experience and strive for excellence in future projects. Thank you for your consideration and understanding.
